**1. Problem Area/Domain:**
Stock price forecasting is the most important and interesting area for investors.
Today, most people, especially young people, are turning to investing and making money through trading, again from the stock market, crypto market, etc. 
Let's try to understand what is the real reason for this study. In the current trading scenario, the stock price prediction is very attractive to investigate and study. 
The system helps traders directly/indirectly by providing them with productive information. 
Stock Price Prediction will help you predict the future value of a stock.
Predicting stock prices is a very difficult task. 
The stock market depends on government policies, natural disasters, economic data, speculation, supply and demand, international transactions and many other factors..

**2. Tentative Problem(s)/Objective(s):**
1. To predict the stock price in order to make investor aware and make
precise decision.
2. Study stock market trends and factors affecting stock prices.
3. Helps to understand the sentiments and predict future value of stocks of a company.

   
**3. Proposed Solution(s)/Your Role:**
The main motivation behind our stock price prediction system is to provide proper information about stocks, which stock will go up and which one will go down.
However, making money in stock market is very hard because the stock market is very unpredictable.
Many. People don’t even know which stock to buy and sell. We are going to compile datasets taken from Kaggle containing past information about company’s stocks.

We will use long short term memory (LSTM) , which is an important part of deep learning and basically used for prediction systems. 
By using LSTM we will get help in managing long term dependencies. Some steps like pre-processing and cleaning of data will be implemented later. Then we’ll train
our model and try to predict what percentage the inventory will increase in next few days. After performing, testing and training model we would be able to touch
and solve our problem and facilitate the profit of investor.
